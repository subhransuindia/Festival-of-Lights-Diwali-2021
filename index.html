<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Festive Season!! Diwali just crossed us and ended the festive surrounding (see the transition, ough ough). So don‚Äôt lose hope, there are many festivals coming up? So, with a chill of November, this month welcomes the Diwali festival or deepavali. Diwali is celebrated to welcome Ram in Ayodyha. Basically, Ram, the emperor of Ayodhya came to his Empire after 12 years of <i>‚Äòvanvas‚Äô</i> with his wife sita and his brother laxman. In the duration of <i>‚Äòvanvas‚Äô</i> Sita had been abducted by Ravana. So after defeating Ravana, Ram, Sita and Laxman came back to their empire. People of Ayodhya were so much happy that they light up all the street of Ayodhya with diyas to welcome lord Ram, Sita and Laxman. So after that day, this day is celebrated as Diwali‚Ä¶ I need not tell this story because everyone knows it. So, let‚Äôs begin my experience of Diwali in the year 2021‚Ä¶</p>
<h1>Spinning light</h1> 
<p>So, before Diwali, OFC, we should decorate the house. So on a one fine day my mother and my father went to the market. And I was watching <i>Beyblade‚Ä¶</i> My Grandmother was on the rooftop‚Ä¶ So, after a while, tired, I waited for my parents to come. Then suddenly, bell rangs and my feet was eager to be straight.. So as I opened the door, my mother surprised me by saying that she had bought something special for me. My enthusiastic mind and heart was very much curious. Then suddenly, my <i>mama</i> took out a rotating light bulb, I was sooo much happy that I danced with my fullest. ü§£ü§£ü§£. Yes, it is 100% true. It is in front of my eyes, the one thing I wanted the most. üòåüòå. THE SPINNING LIGHT or rotating light‚Ä¶ <u>whatever you say..</u></p> 

<h1>Same Night d√©cor, a hard work</h1>
<p>So on the same night, I insisted my father a lot to d√©cor the window. I mustn‚Äôt insist as he was busy but my father also agreed to it, so we started the decoration. So, first thing was to fix the bulb to window. So, I had a bulb holder and a switch. I had bought this for some practical work in class 6. It was not used for practical but it helped in this type of work üòÅ. Now, here‚Äôs a thing, finding wool was utterly difficult. So after successfully finding the wool we tied that bulb holder or bulbul holder üòÇüòÇ. After all thing was ready, now my turn of work came into place. So what, I had to go to the ground floor and come back to our flat‚Äôs floor to inform the situation till I know that I can communicate with mobile <i>ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</i>. So after a hard work, the result was negative, we could not keep the light in right place‚Ä¶üò•</p>

<h1>Outdoor D√©cor</h1>
<p>Outdooor D√©cor, it has a separate fan base.. I like it the most. So after two days of placing <i>bulbul</i> holder in <i>wrong place</i>, we decided to decorate the outside of or house with lights‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>So, we had a green color, yellow color, red color, purple color and ‚Äòdim and glow‚Äô lights. I had decided to build a diya‚Ä¶ but here is a problem, for making diya or whatever, we had to stick the cello tapes which can roll out the paint in the wall. So, my father suggested an idea, tying string and then keeping the lights with the help of these strings. Great idea, na? So we started the d√©cor of our outdoor!</p>
<h2>Making Diya, a failure</h2>
<p>So first, I decided to make a diya with lights, we tied the string from one end to other end. Then, we made a curved shape and then a small curved shape, but, here‚Äôs a thing, diya has OFC a fire. So for making that, we had to tie another string, after tying we first made the fire and then made a curve, but, the end side was on the opposite side of the other side which we would make the diya, So, after a failure, we decided to only make the curves‚Ä¶.</p>
<h2>Keeping the spinning bulb in outdoor</h2>
<p>Where to keep the spinning bulb? We decided to keep in the outdoor‚Ä¶ Placing it was difficult, No place to keep.. If we keep it on the door, it would definitely slip and then if we would keep on the opposite side, no place is there, and if we would be keeping it on our left to the house, no place to keep there also‚Ä¶ So we kept it on the right side. It wasn‚Äôt preferable but we had this only one choice‚Ä¶   So after tying there, our <u>DIWALI D√âCOR WAS COMPLETE!!!!</u></p>
<h1>The day comes</h1>
<p>The most awaited day, Diwali had come!! But that day, I woke up late at morning üòê. So it was going on like a regular (Why but every morning and afternoon is same for me except evening, it is a good topic, we have discuss on it‚Ä¶ Viewers be like :- ‚ÄòKitna off topic jata hai‚Äô) Ok I am back, so where we are, ha,  so afternoon was also same but not same from 3pm üôÉüôÉ.</p>

  <h1>NEW TATA SKY BOX!!!</h1>
<p>So we give gifts to our friends and relative on Diwali, but I got a gift in Diwali‚Ä¶ it happened too soon. Tata Sky service, I don‚Äôt know for what reason, called my father (It could be advertising call) They suggested my father for a HD Set up Box, since we had a SD box. So, we were also eager to buy it because that set up box ran for 5 years and it was also giving white lines and these were so many, so after deciding, we said them to come after 9th November 2021. But I was shocked by the fact that they were coming today. As I was watching tv, I didn‚Äôt give much attention to the call‚Ä¶ I was too much happy‚Ä¶    </p> 
<h1>Diwali chapter of Memories.docx </h1>
<div>
<p>So, after 6 pm, the crackers sound came up, this sound reminds me of the days of Dehradun‚Ä¶ Crackers was very much close to my childhood, as a child I was very much fearful of crackers, mainly of their sound. Whenever Diwali comes I would get ready to be on the room and not keeping an inch of my foot to the outdoor. But it never occurred, my foot comes out, because of my sisters, specially my sister who was younger that my other elder sister but was elder than me. So, she would just grab me and pull me out of the pole. OFC, she would win but when my last armor comes, my cry, then she would definitely lose. These are just some of the text from ‚ÄòMemories.docx‚Äô from my mind‚Ä¶</p>

</div>

<h1>Enjoyable Night </h1>
<p>I am just getting emotional‚Ä¶ So now, I was just screaming (Not really!)  that I want to go to the rooftop. But my parents were busy. So I waited till it was 9!! So after a three hour of waiting, my mother and my grandmother went to the rooftop with me. So after going, mama took out the sparkles <i>(fooljhadi)</i> And then after enjoying with these sparkels, my Diwali experience ended. </p>
